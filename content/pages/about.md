# About Me

<img alt="Photo of me" src="{static}/img/profile.jpg" class="side-pic">

Hi, I'm Thomas Dargent and I'm a Master Student in Data Science. I live in Rouen in France, and as such study in the Universit√© of Rouen Normandie.
I'm interested by image segmentation and computer vision for Medical images and Ecological applications.

In my free time I like to read about the world, try to do my share of good in it, do sports, cook, and make side projects.

I love to meet people and would be happy if I can be of any help (but I might take some time to respond !). Contact me on:

You may find some of my works under the username *Kalwing*.

# About this site
This website is built with Pelican. I tried to make it very minimal and "low-tech". Of course MathJax, d3 and other heavy JS stuff aren't quite minimal, but I still wanted a nice reading experience so... hey, life is a nerverending succession of compromises.
