# About Me

<img alt="Photo of me" src="{static}/img/profile.jpg" class="side-pic">

Hi, I'm **Thomas Dargent** and I'm a *PhD Student* et the *Universit√© of Rouen Normandy* in France.
I'm interested by *image segmentation* and computer vision for *medical images*. My thesis is about using specificity of ORL cancer to develop *geometricaly constrained losses* and *multitask networks*.

In my free time I like to read about the world, try to do my share of good in it, do sports, cook, and make side projects.

I love to meet people and would be happy if I can be of any help (but I might take some time to respond !). Contact me on:  

* [E-mail](mailto:thomas.dargent@etu.univ-rouen.fr)

You may find some of my works under the username **Kalwing**.

# About this site
This website is built with Pelican. I tried to make it very minimal and "low-tech". Of course MathJax, D3 and other heavy JS stuff aren't quite minimal, but I still wanted a nice reading experience so... hey, life is a nerverending succession of compromises.
