    <ul>
        <li><b>Evaluating RV Quantification:</b> Currently there is no consensus
             on right ventricular quantification. Our goal is to implement
             state of the art quantification method for shape and strain;
             That will allow us to evaluate each methods’ impact and
             stability under noise.</li>
        <li><b>Perspectives:</b> The work done during this internship could be
            used to make a consensus paper between researchers and the industry
            by my tutors, Dr.&nbsp;Nicolas Duchateau and Dr.&nbsp;Gabriel Bernardino.</li>

        <li><b>Deep learning with geometrically constrained losses:</b>
            Based on the previous work of Pr.&nbsp;Ismail Ben Ayed and Dr.&nbsp;Hoel Kervadec, we extended
            the use of constraints on bounding boxes to 3D.
            Their previous works used geometrical constraints enforced in the loss
            of a CNN to segment organs that were weakly supervised (only a portion
            of the pixels
            labeled, bounding boxes...). We tested if their results still
            worked when the bounding box was defined in 3D, and for
            multi-organ segmentation.</li>

        <li><b>Training an OCR on a handwritten dataset:</b>
            Following my L2 internship, I used a homemade library (OCR CTC, by Dr.&nbsp;Yann Soullard)
            based on Keras to train an OCR like the one I used to get results from.</li>
        <li><b>Evaluating the capacity of adaptation of a deep learning model to specific writers:</b>
        We wondered if a model could be trained to improve its result on a specific writer, with few examples.
        The results were inconclusive. We used CNN and BLSTM,
        L2-SP regularization, Data augmentation (Elastic distortion). - <a href="http://thomasdargent.com/stage-l3">thomasdargent.com/stage-l3</a>
