I live in Rouen in France, and as such I study in the <em>Université of Rouen Normandie</em>. I'm interested by <em>image segmentation</em> and computer vision for <em>medical images</em>. I would also like to learn more about possible <em>ecological applications</em> of Machine Learning.</p> <p>In my free time I like to read about the world, try to do my share of good in it, do sports, cook, and make side projects.</p> <p>I love to meet people and would be happy if I can be of any help (but I might take some time to respond !).

I tried to make it very minimal and "low-tech". Of course MathJax, D3 and other heavy JS stuff aren't quite minimal, but I still wanted a nice reading experience so... hey, life is a nerverending succession of compromises.</p> <footer> Powered by <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, "Moineau" theme by Thomas Dargent </footer> </div> <!--Used for pelican_dynamic-->
